# pruritus

Convenient modding API for the [itch.io](https://itch.io) desktop app ([itch](https://github.com/itchio/itch) (kitch)).

This is developed independently of itch instead of forking the original software in order to benefit from itch's update servers and to stay consistently up-to-date with the latest version of itch.
