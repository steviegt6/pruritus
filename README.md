~~Convenient modding API for the [itch.io](https://itch.io) desktop app ([itch](https://github.com/itchio/itch) (kitch)).~~

~~This is developed independently of itch instead of forking the original software in order to benefit from itch's update servers and to stay consistently up-to-date with the latest version of itch.~~

pruritus was originally being developed as an API for modifying the itch.io desktop app since I didn't really expect the average user to want to use a fork, but I realized that the repository has been more or less dead for a while.

Decided it'd indeed be best to just... fork it. See the fork [here](https://github.com/steviegt6/itch).

This repository will continue to exist, just archived; I believe there's some interesting technology for undoing Webpack here.
